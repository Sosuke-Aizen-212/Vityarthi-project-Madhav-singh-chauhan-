## 🎯 Project Overview

This project serves as a practical implementation of fundamental programming concepts learned in an introductory course like **CSE1021: Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming**. It allows users to:

- Log income and expense transactions
- View real-time financial summaries
- Analyze spending by category with percentage breakdowns
- Persist data across sessions using JSON storage

The goal is to reinforce understanding of control structures, data types, functions, and file I/O while building a functional tool.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Add Income**  
Record sources of income (e.g., salary, freelance, gifts) with amount, source, and description.

✅ **Add Expense**  
Log expenses categorized by purpose (e.g., Food, Rent, Transport) for better organization.

- Total Income  
- Total Expenses  
- Net Balance (color-coded: green for positive, red for negative)  
- **Categorical Expense Analysis**: See how much each category contributes to overall spending (in percentages).

✅ **View All Transactions**  
Display a neatly formatted, color-coded table of all recorded transactions with IDs, types, amounts, categories/sources, and descriptions.

✅ **Auto-Save on Exit**  
All data is automatically saved to `finance_data.json` when exiting, and reloaded on next startup.

✅ **User-Friendly CLI Interface**  
Clean menu navigation with input validation and colorful feedback using ANSI escape codes.

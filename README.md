# Smart Finance Tracker

This is a simple, command-line interface (CLI) application developed in Python to help users track their personal income and expenses. It provides a quick way to record financial transactions, view a comprehensive summary, and analyze spending patterns by category.

# Features

The application provides the following core functionalities through an interactive menu:

- **Add Income**: Record a new income transaction with the amount, source, and description.

- **Add Expense**: Record a new expense transaction with the amount, category, and description.

- **View Summary & Breakdown**:
  - Displays Total Income, Total Expense, and Net Balance.
  - Provides a Categorical Breakdown of expenses, including the percentage each category contributes to the total spending, offering a basic form of financial analysis.

- **View All Transactions**: Lists all recorded transactions with clear, color-coded formatting for easy readability.

- **Save & Exit**: Automatically saves all transaction data to a local `summary_report.csv` file before exiting, ensuring data persistence.

## Files

- `SmartFinanceTracker.py` - Code
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  How to Run

1. **Prerequisite**  
   Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine.

2. **Save the File**  
   Drop the code into a file named `finance_tracker.py`.

3. **Execute**  
   Open your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file, and run:  
   ```bash
   python finance_tracker.py
   ```
4. **Interact**
   Follow the on-screen menu prompts—type 1 to add income, 3 for a summary, etc.

## Educational Concepts Demonstrated

This project integrates several key programming concepts from the course curriculum:

| Course Concept (Unit/Experiment)        | Implementation in `Tracker`                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lists and Dictionaries (Unit 5)         | Uses a `TRANSACTIONS` list to store all records, with each record as a dictionary. Dictionaries are also used for `category_totals` in the summary. |
| Input and Output (Exp. 2)               | Uses `input()` to receive transaction details and `print()` with ANSI color codes for clear, readable console output. |
| Functions (Unit 2)                      | Breaks logic into reusable functions such as `add_transaction()`, `view_summary()`, `load_data()`, and `save_data()`. |
| Control Flow (if/else, while) (Unit 3, Exp. 4) | The `main_menu()` function uses a `while True` loop and `if` / `elif` / `else` statements to control the application flow based on user choices. |
| Summation (Unit 3)                      | Implements summation logic in `view_summary()` to calculate `total_income`, `total_expense`, and `balance`. |
| Data Persistence                        | Uses Python’s built-in `json` library to save and load transaction data, preserving user data between sessions. |

## Output

The model provides:
- Binary prediction (Diabetic/Not Diabetic)
- Probability scores for both classes
